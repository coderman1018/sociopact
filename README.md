SocioPact is just the app required to create a "friendly vibe" in any neighborhood. With this app, people living in the same area can ask for help with any task and an available neighbor can volunteer their services.
I have added a rating feature, which allows the user to rate the helper on the basis of how friendly, punctual and efficient they were. The rating decides the number of points the helper gets.
SocioPact has a "level-up" feature. If a user helps enough people, while also earning good ratings from them, they gain points and eventually level up. On reaching a specified level, they can win a prize.
SocioPact has a neighborhood "Leaderboard". If a person fininshed first after one week, they get additional points added to their score.
